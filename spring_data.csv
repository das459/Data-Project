The spring is a source of drinking water for wildlife and feral Burros. In 1998, feral Burros were captured and removed from around the area. The Burro impacts to the spring site were multiple trailing, distortion of vegetation, and fecal contamination of the water. Since the removal of the Burros from this spring site, there has been visible rejuvenation to the surrounding area with less trailing and increased re-growth of the damaged vegetation.

The walls of this cave have been reinforced by support beams to prevent subsidence and potential loss of this water source. The water here has been utilized to provide livestock with drinking water. This was accomplished by tapping water from the cave to a 3000-gallon storage tank at the bottom of this ravine using PVC pipe. This tank in turn feeds a concrete water trough.
